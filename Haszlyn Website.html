      <h1>Hello </h1> 
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">Hi, my name is Haszlyn Shafiyah Binti Haspizul but my friends call me Hasz. I was born in Banting Hospital on 1 April 2004 so my age this year is 21. so I am from Banting and currently live in Banting. I am an only child but I have other siblings who have different mothers but the same father. My mother's name is Junaini while my father's name is Haspizul. They divorced when I was 10 years old. In my free time I like to read novels, watch dramas, and listen to songs. Currently, I prefer sad songs or people call them galau songs. I also like nature because sometimes I follow my friends to climb the hill. it is tiring but after reaching the top, the tiredness will be worth it with the view at the top.</p>

      <h1>Education</h1> 
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">I started my education at Tadika Desa Cahaya located in Kampung Sawah Banting Selangor. After that I continued my education at the primary level which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Buaya and Sekolah Agama Sungai Buaya which is located in Kampung Sungai Buaya Banting. At the secondary level I continued my schooling session at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Jugra which is also located in Banting Selangor. After getting my SPM results, I continued my education by taking the UiTM Pre-Diploma at UiTM Arau Perlis for one semester and now I am in the final semester of the diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau Negeri Sembilan. Lastly, I'm still thinking about whether to continue my studies to a degree or not.</p>
